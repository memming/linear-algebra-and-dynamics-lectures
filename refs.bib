  abstract  = "Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the
               physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of
               boundaries between scienti?c disciplines and a resurgence of
               interest in the modern as well as the cl- sical techniques of
               applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in research
               and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series Texts
               in Applied Mathematics (TAM).

               excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as
               numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and
               chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied
               mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to
               meet the current and future needs of these advances and to
               encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish
               textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and
               beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Ma-
               ematical Sciences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced
               textbooks and research-level monographs. Pasadena, California

               two-semester course in ordinary di?erential eq- tions that I
               have taught to graduate students for two decades at the U-
               versity of Missouri. The scope of the narrative evolved over
               time from an embryonic collection of supplementary notes,
               through many classroom tested revisions, to a treatment of the
               subject that is suitable for a year (or more) of graduate study.",
